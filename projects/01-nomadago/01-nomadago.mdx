Drove the design, development, and launch of a social network for iOS and Android, which rapidly gained traction globally among digital nomads. Took primary responsibility for architecting and building the React Native application, a Gatsby.js marketing website, and a Next.js business portal. I also led collaborations with outsourced engineers and designers, ensuring alignment with quality standards.
