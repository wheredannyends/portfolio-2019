Berriton is an interactive point-and-click game. Users are taken on an adventure throughout the land, where they collect berries and use them to unravel the mysteries Berriton has to offer

Berriton was the combined final project for 4 courses in my second term at BCIT. As the main developer for the project, I was responsible for coding the majority of the game's functionality. Along the way, I realized that to create a more intuitive user interface, I had to design several UI elements and interactive menus. This project resulted in a perfect mark, and has been shown to following classes as an example of good work
