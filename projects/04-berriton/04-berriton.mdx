Berriton is an interactive adventure where users unravel the mysteries of the land on a berry-collecting journey. As the sole developer on the project, I was responsible for coding the game's functionality. I also aided in designing an intuitive user interface and heads-up display to aid users in their quest. The project was built with exclusively vanilla JavaScript, with Sass for styling.
