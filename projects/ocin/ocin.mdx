OCIN is a Vancouver-based swimwear brand that inspires a concious effort to keep the oceans clean. It was built upon Shopify's Slate toolset with Sass pre-processing the CSS and Vanilla JavaScript for the simple interactivity. I worked closely with the brand creator and a sub-contracted UI designer to create a web experience that conveyed the brandâ€˜s identity while remaining user-friendly.
