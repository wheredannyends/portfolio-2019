FamJam is an app that combined a real-time chat, shopping list, to-do list, and calendar. These features were determined through research to be some of the most important things needed to keep a household organized. I was the lead developer in this full-stack web application built on a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and deployed in a CICD pipeline on Heroku.
