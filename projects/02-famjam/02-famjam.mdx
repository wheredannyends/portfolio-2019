FamJam paves the path to household efficiency by seamlessly bringing together the family calendar, shopping list, chores list and group message. These are the 4 most important aspects for an organized household and FamJam includes them all in one easy to use application.

FamJam was the last major project done during my time at BCIT that required our group to create a full-stack web application. We used a MERN stack to build the application, and launched it using Heroku's cloud hosting.
